  ## Description
Aggretsukos is a website designed to elevate karaoke bar experiences for both employees and guests. Guests are able to create a log-in and order food/beverage items, they are given approximate wait times for these items and are able to view their order history, they can make song requests and view the request history of the night, and receive a notification when their turn is next.


## User Story

For Guests:
  AS A User who wants to party all night  
  I WANT to avoid giving my card to bartenders, be notified via my mobile device when it is my turn to perform, log-in and see my previous song history and order history, be given approximate wait times for food and beverages.  
  SO THAT I can have a seamless, great night with my friends  

For Employees:  
  AS A User who wants to maintain guest safety, expedite service and increases sales  
  I WANT an application that pre-verifies legal age, sends electronic receipt of sales, and automatically cuts of sale of alcohol once guest has reached the state's suggested maximum consumption every 60 minutes and auto recommends food menu items  
  SO THAT they can have a great time and get home safely  


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN that a user accesses the application  
WHEN the user is asked to verify legal age  
THEN they are presented with the application's homepage to log-in  

GIVEN that a user wants to make a song request  
WHEN the user has ordered the venue's minimum of two menu items  
THEN the song request tab is enabled and the user can make a request  

WHEN a user has chosen a song request  
THEN the user should be alerted with approximate wait time until performance and/or their number in line  

GIVEN that a user has been presented with menu choices  
WHEN the user is viewing the resulting items  
THEN the user is able to confirm ID via mobile app, purchase through app and view receipt  

GIVEN that a server receives an order  
WHEN the server views how many drinks a guest has ordered and has observed the guest  
THEN the server can decide whether or not to disable alcohol menu ordering.
